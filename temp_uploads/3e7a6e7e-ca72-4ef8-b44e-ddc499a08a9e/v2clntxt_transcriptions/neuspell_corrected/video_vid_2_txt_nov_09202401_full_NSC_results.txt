good morning i'm good how are you hows your holiday

 that's great that's great yeah yeah yeah my turn my turn my turn soon it's just in the middle guess yeah

 yeah i think the bad part if there's nothing changed it should be okay i mean but of course we expect change very often so i'm trying to reconstruct the database for us for easier to do yeah but we can talk about that later but yes bad part is okay and i'm starting to do some priorities

 yeah as you can see so hows john talk us discussion with you

 what is that about of yeah yeah yeah yeah

 but what what does it do about us we can't we can't change like take a five two of i see

 what what is that

 follow steering of yeah we do astrology cementation and vehicle file wow

 hall hall

 of sorry sorry i disconnected i missed like for one minute my internet is not good

 what's your idea yeah i missed that part for detail i know the headline

 yeah claim is the worst i mean the weakest

 because knowledge in claims

 yeah i think

 hi sorry about that my internet connection is not very good so i just missed that part for 30 seconds sorry

 place i've just occupied my kids toys room okay okay

 just a moment please hello yeah yeah thank you yeah i think so yeah at least we

 exactly right so just to recap then so we've got the five priorities so we've got vehicle level stuff we've got cross sell we've got the renewal strategy we've got segmentation and we've got claims those are our five high level priorities and then you've got everything else that sits around that like bad and queries it center so i think to my question for you i suppose

 is of those five topics what have you been looking at and how far have you got with them and then what more can either you or i do to get them done and i think we need to have a session because on you showing me how the bad now works because it looks like it's quite i mean obviously you made it all automated but i still need to know how to run it

 okay before that we have some talks and okay i can show you the how be a you runs first okay

 hopefully it won't drop okay can you see the screen now yeah i can see the screen okay us so
