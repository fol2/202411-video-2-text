 That's great. That's great Yeah, yeah, yeah my turn my turn my turn soon, it's just in the middle guess Yeah
 Yeah, I think the BAU part, if there's nothing changed, it should be okay. I mean, but of course, we expect change very often. So I'm trying to reconstruct the database for us, for easier to do. Yeah, but we can talk about that later. But yes, BAU part is okay. And I'm starting to do some priorities. 
 yeah as you can see so how's john talk uh discussion with you

 Oh, sorry, sorry, I disconnected I missed like for one minute My internet is not good
 What's your idea? Yeah, I missed that part for detail. I know the headline. 
 Yeah, claim is the worst I mean the weakest
 because knowledge in claims
 Yeah, I think
 Hi, sorry about that. My internet connection is not very good. So I just missed that part for 30 seconds. Sorry. 
 Place I've just occupied my kids toys room Okay, okay
 Just a moment, please hello Yeah, yeah, thank you. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, at least we
 Exactly. Right. So just to recap then, so we've got the five priorities. So we've got vehicle level stuff, we've got cross-sell, we've got the renewal strategy, we've got segmentation, and we've got claims. Those are our five high-level priorities. And then you've got everything else that sits around that, like BAU and queries, et cetera. So I think, to my question for you, I suppose,
 is of those five topics, what have you been looking at and how far have you got with them? And then what more can either you or I do to get them done? And I think we need to have a session because on you showing me how the BAU now works, because it looks like it's quite. . . I mean, obviously you made it all automated, but I still need to know how to run it. 
 Okay before that we have some talks and okay, I can show you the how be a you runs first, okay
